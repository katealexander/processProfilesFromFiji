# Process Profiles From Fiji
Analysis of immunofluorescence data using Fiji to create intensity profiles and Python to process them. This analysis is fairly specific to particular dataset, and is likely not broadly useful.
## Collect intensity profiles from Fiji
## Generate normalized profiles for making heatmaps, find the number of profiles with p53 local maxima near the speckle and near the transcription site
## Return a table of p53 intensities in speckles, outside of speckles, and inside divided by outside of speckles
## Return a table of p53 intensities at the transcription site, outside of the transcription site, and at divided by outside the transcription site
